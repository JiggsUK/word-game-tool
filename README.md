# word-game-tool
This is a basic tool to help players of word games based around Scrabble find the score of their words and assist them selecting the optimal word.

# Project Plan
## Current Stage
### Phase 1: Score Finder 
The user enters their word and it calculates the base score in scrabble based on the letter values only.

#### Initial Design Idea
1. Ask the user to enter their word
2. Calculate the word score by summing the letter values based on scrabble letter values
3. Return the score and display it to the user


## Planned Future Stages
### Phase 2: Score Compare 
The user gives 2 words and the program indicates which is the better scorer based on the letter values only.

### Phase 3: Gameboard Setup
Allow user to set out their current board which the above tools can be utilised to calculate the optimal word and its placement on the board

### Phase 4: Word Finder 
Essentially an anagram solver - the user gives their letters and this shows them the best scoring word (or top 5 words, etc) they can make with them. Could also make use of the gameboard to show placement options too.

### Phase 5: Graphical User Interface
Build a user interface for the tool.
