# Project details
"Very basic tool, ideal for complete beginners.
I see this project as building one part on top of the other, not individual programs. This will allow beginners to consider building a basic menu of which part a user wants to do.

I have done part 1 and 2 in python before so I know roughly what we need to do, but I wanted something even beginners can help build. So, I'm starting from scratch with this and we can see what we come up with together. Then as everyone progresses we can look at part 3 and 4 which I have never done before and thought it would be good to tackle together.

The 4 parts

Part 1: Score Finder - user enters their word and it calculates the score in scrabble

Part 2: Score Compare - user gives 2 words and you indicate which is the better scorer

Part 3: Word Finder - user gives their letters and tool shows them the best scoring word (or top 5 words) they can make with them

Part 4: Build a user interface for the tool"



# General plan

part 1:
1. Create a game board on which the player (user) can place their letters
2. use the letter multiplier and letter score to calculate the base score of the word
3. use the word multiplier to calculate the total score of the word
